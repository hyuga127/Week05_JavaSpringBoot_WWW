# Project Title: [Job Recruitment Website – WWW Week 5 Assignment]
# Student: Tran Gia Huy – Student ID: 21121781

## Introduction
This project was developed with the goal of using Java Spring Boot to build a web application. The main purpose is to create an efficient information management system that meets the data management needs of businesses or organizations. With the solid foundation of Spring Boot, I implemented essential features such as resource management, user authorization, and database integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Spring Boot**: The core framework for developing the web application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Manages database interactions and object-relational mapping.
- **Thymeleaf**: Builds dynamic HTML templates for the user interface.
- **MySQL Database**: Provides reliable data storage for development and testing.
- **Spring Security**: Handles authentication and user authorization.
- **Gradle**: Project build and dependency management tool.
